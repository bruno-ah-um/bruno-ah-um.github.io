I’m thrilled to share some exciting news: I have been accepted into the **Qiskit Advocate Program**!  

The Qiskit Advocate Program is an amazing initiative for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts passionate about **quantum computing**. Being part of this program is a fantastic opportunity to learn, contribute, and collaborate with the global Qiskit community.  

As a Qiskit Advocate, I’ll be diving deeper into quantum software, sharing knowledge, and helping grow the ecosystem.

This marks an exciting milestone in my quantum computing journey, and I’m looking forward to exploring new challenges, experiments, and projects.
